# My-Website-source-code
OK So this is the orignal file that you may have downloaded from GitHub
So basically, you are allowed to look at the code and my style and replicate it but stealing any code or mnaking changes and uploading it is not fine and your file will be taken down.
It is all orignal code and has not been stolen from anywhere, i learned all of this from doing web courses
Hope you understand the pain of a dev and happy coding :)
